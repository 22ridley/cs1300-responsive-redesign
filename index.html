        <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
        <p class="name">Sarah Ridley ● Brown University ● March 2025</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="txt-bx">
          <p>
            &emsp;'Responsive' websites use HTML and CSS to automatically resize
            or rearrange their content as the screen's dimensions change. Many
            high-profile websites prioritize responsiveness, however, many
            others with less resources for development and maintenance do not
            react to screen dimensions. In this case study, I take one such
            website and redesign its homepage for responsiveness.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="id" class="id">
        <h2>Identification</h2>
        <div class="txt-bx">
          <p>
            &emsp;The website I identified for this redesign is the homepage for
            the
            <a
              href="https://www.ncdentalboard.org/index.htm"
              target="_blank"
              class="link"
              >North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners</a
            >. I chose this website because it provides important information
            that pertains to many North Carolina citizens, however, it seems
            that the board has not invested the resources to make their site
            responsive.
          </p>
          <h3>Screenshots</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;The screenshots below display the current North Carolina State
            Board of Dentail Examiners (NCSBDE) website at various screen widths
            (375x667px, 768x1024px, and 3840x2160px). These screen widths
            represent the view on mobile, tablet, and computer respectively. As
            shown, the website does not consistently resize or rearrange its
            content depending on screen size, and instead, content often gets
            cut off.

          <h3>Usability & Accessibility Issues</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;After exploring the NCSBDE homepage, I compiled this table of
            the
            <a
              class="link"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/"
              >usability</a
            >
            (learnability, memorability, and efficiency) and accessibility
            issues I identified with the website. To detect accessibility
            issues, I used the tool
            <a class="link" href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank"
              >WebAIM WAVE</a
            >, which automatically detects possible accessibility problems.
          </p>
          <br />
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th style="width: 10%">Learnability</th>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Since learnability refers to the ability of new users to
                    accomplish tasks, one learnability problem is the presence
                    of many external deadlinks on the page. For example, the
                    pages tries to link to the NC Secretary of State website,
                    <a
                      href="www.secstate.state.nc.us"
                      target="_blank"
                      class="link"
                      >www.secstate.state.nc.us</a
                    >, but this is a deadlink, which is confusing for new users
                    who are trying to navigate this page's resources for the
                    first time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The NCSBDE homepage also links to other pages within the
                    NCSBDE site in confusing and disjointed ways, since there is
                    a header in purple of pages to navigate to, another row in
                    red of pages below that, as well as a column along the left
                    side of other pages. This disjoint makes it diffult for new
                    users to find the page they need.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A related learnability problem is that the links to 3 more
                    pages are hidden and only show up as a dropdown on hover
                    over Live Scan. This makes it much more difficult for new
                    users to find these hidden pages, including `CBC
                    Requirements', unless they already know to look under Live
                    Scan.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Memorability</th>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    One memorability problem is that the sheer number of
                    navigable pages from the homepage makes it difficult to
                    remember where a page you have been to before is. Worse,
                    several of these links are very similar and could be
                    consolidated for efficiency. For example,
                    'Anesthesia/Sedation Permits' could be a subpage of 'License
                    & Permits'. With fewer options visible (and with each option
                    using more space), users can more easily spacially remember
                    what link they want to click.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Another memorability problem with the NCSBDE website is the
                    lack of coordination of colors. The top header nav bar is
                    purple, while the nav bar below that is red, and the nav bar
                    column along the left has no background color. Colors can be
                    a valuable memory trigger for users to remember
                    functionality of components, so a lack of standardization
                    further impedes returning users' abilities to navigate the
                    page.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Efficiency</th>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    One strange efficiency problem is that if the user clicks
                    the 'Verification/Disciplinary History' link on the left
                    column, several of the links in the left column disappear,
                    including `Anesthesia / Sedation Permits'. This
                    inconsistency in the left column nav bar happens on several
                    pages. This impedes efficiency because if someone needs to
                    go to 'Verification/Disciplinary History' and then
                    'Anesthesia/Sedation Permits', they have to go back to the
                    homepage in between.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Another efficiency problem with the homepage is that none of
                    the links to exteral websites open in a new window. This
                    means that if experienced users need to go to one of those
                    external pages, then back to the MCSBDE page, they either
                    have to manually open new tabs or have to go back in their
                    history. This is an efficiency issue because it impedes the
                    speed of all users, including experienced ones.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Additionally, the height of this homepage impedes
                    efficiency, given that this single homepage is incredibly
                    long and has 25 subsections. There is no table of contents
                    nor hyperlinks to these subsubsections, so even experienced
                    users who know where they need to go still have to spend a
                    lot of time scrolling to get there.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Accessibility</th>
              <td>
                <p class="pad">
                  WebAIM Wave discovered many accessibility issues. Below are
                  those that I agree with most and found most concerning.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    'No heading structure': The page has no headings, instead,
                    all the text is within a div, span, or p, and manually
                    styled. This oversight makes it more difficult for Screen
                    Readers to report the structure of this page to users
                    without impairments. In turn, this makes it more difficult
                    for these users to navigate the page.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    'Null or empty alternative text': None of the images on this
                    page have alternative text. This means that Screen Readers
                    cannot report their contents to visually impaired users.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    'Very low contrast between text and background colors': On
                    the left side of the page, there is a sticky box with the
                    label 'Functions of the Board of Dental Examiners' whose
                    green text and green background are very close shades of
                    green. This makes it difficult for colorblind or otherwise
                    visually-impaired users to read this text.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="pad">
                  In addition to these issues, in my opinion, the biggest
                  accessibility issue is this page's lack of responsiveness.
                  When the screen is narrow, its contents get cut off, which
                  makes it virtually impossible for users with small screens and
                  physical impairments to use the site.

            &emsp;As described, the NCSBDE website suffers from a variety of
            learnability, memorability, efficiency, and accessibly issues. The
            most common themes are the confusing nature of the 3 separate nav
            components, the lack of color coordination, the long height of the
            page and lack of structure, and the lack of responsiveness to narrow
            screens. Addressing each problem would improve the user experience
            and ease of use, not just for those with accessibility issues or new
            users, but for all users.

          <p>
            &emsp;After identifying these usability and accessibility issues, I
            redesigned the homepage of the NCSBDE website with these concerns in
            mind. Before recreating the website with HTML and CSS, I created a
            visual design style guide and mockups with the design tool Figma.
          </p>
          <h3>Visual Design Style Guide</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;This guide contains the main colors, typography, and reusable
            components for my mockups and redesigned webpage. Creating a
            consistent palette and matching components improved the coordination
            and cohesiveness of my final redesign, and ideally improves the user
            experience. If the embedded Figma file does not load, please find it

            &emsp;The following mockups display my redesign of the NCSBDE home
            page on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. This redesign
            prioritizes responsiveness by reusing styling, layout, and
            components between screen sizes, while still adjusting to new
            proportions. If the embedded Figma file does not load, please find

          <h3>Usability & Accessibility Notes</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;My redesigns attempt to address the usability and
            accessibility issues I identified early in the following ways.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Learnability:</b> My redesign addresses learnabiity by
              consolidating the links to other NCSBDE pages. On computer, these
              internal links are all within the header and the dropdowns from
              the header. On mobile and tablet, these internal links are within
              the hamburger popup. Consolidating these links from 3 locations
              into only 1 makes the homepage more learnable because it makes
              navigating the site easier for first-time users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Memorability:</b> I addressed memorability by coordinating the
              color palette and reducing the number of internal links in the
              header/hamburger popup. First, I made the header, as well as all
              subsections of the homepage the color grape, to unify the
              navigational components of the page. By reducing the color palette
              to only a few coordinated accent colors, the page is more cohesive
              and its elements are more memorable to returning users. Also,
              reducing the number of internal links makes it faster for
              returning users to find which page they need to revisit.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Efficiency:</b> My redesign addresses efficiency by reducing
              the length of the homepage. Instead of including all 25
              subsections, I kept only the five most recently-added subsections,
              and then added an 'Archive' section which would link to old
              subsections. I also created a table of contents to scroll to each
              subsection, which improves efficiency by allowing experienced
              users to navigate to the section they need more quickly (instead
              of scrolling manually).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Accessibility:</b> I addressed accessibility primarily by
              making the homepage responsive, which allows users to access all
              functionalities of the homepage regardless of screen size. I also
              added alt text to all images, using headers to create structure,
              and carefully chose font colors and background colors to
              prioritize contrast and readability. Each of these choices removes
              barriers from people with physical and visual impairments to
              interact with the homepage.

          <h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;To implement the above mockups, any developer would need extra
            details and annotations on the intentions of the design. The below
            annotations further explore the ideas behind my designs and how to
            bring them to life. The mobile and tablet redesigns are grouped and
            the computer redesign is separate, since tablet and mobile have a
            lot in common (although their differences are described below).

                <h3>Differences</h3>
                <li>
                  As visible above, my structure of the mockups for the mobile
                  screen and tablet screen sizes are very similar. The main
                  difference is font size, as on the mobile screen, the default
                  size of the paragraph text is 12px, while it is 15px on
                  tablet.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Regarding moving in between tablet and mobile sizes, the text
                  size will scale according to the screen width, instead of
                  scaling up at a specific threshold. The horizontal and
                  vertical margins will also scale with screen dimensions, and
                  the defualt margins are 5vh and 5vw.
                </li>
                <h3>Similarities</h3>
                <li>
                  On both mobile and tablet (and unlike computer), the
                  navigation options are not visible along the header, instead
                  they are accessed by opening the menu by pressing the
                  hamburger button on the top right. This interaction is modeled
                  in the Figma mockups.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Similarly, the information bubble on the computer about the
                  'Functions of the Board...' is hidden by default, and
                  available by pressing the information button to the left of
                  the hamburger button. This is also modeled in the mockups.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The header and its buttons will be sticky, and stay in place
                  as the user scrolls along the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The NCSBDE logo will be fully contained in the header, unlike
                  how it sits halfway out of the header on the computer. This
                  logo will be a link back to the top of this homepage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The header will be a grid layout, with 3 columns. The logo
                  will be the first column, and its left margin will be
                  specified to keep it oriented left. The second and third
                  columns will contain the info and hamburger buttons, and their
                  right margins will keep them pushed towards the right of the
                  screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The hamburger and info popups, which are initially hidden,
                  will be flexboxes with a column display, so that the options
                  list down the screen, and each take up as much space as the
                  screen height allows. Also, these popup components will scroll
                  so that if some of the text is hidden, the user can navigate
                  to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each of the items under Table of Contents is a link that
                  brings the user to that section of the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The page's content itself will remain as a block display, and
                  any overflown content will be able to be scrolled down to.
                  There should be no horizontal overflow.
                </li>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Unlike the tablet and mobile displays, on the computer
                  display, the main groups for the navigation options are
                  displayed along the header. As shown in the Figma mockups,
                  when you hover on an option, its font become slightly darker,
                  and when you click on one of these options, a popup window
                  appears and displays the links within that group.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Like on tablet and mobile, the header is sticky, and remains
                  at the top of the page as you scroll. This keeps the
                  navigation accessible on all parts of the page, unlike on the
                  original page, where you have to scroll back up to the top.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The header will be layed out as a grid on the outside with two
                  columns. The first column will only contain the logo, and it
                  will be fixed to be the exact same width as the margin of the
                  text in the content down below. This will ensure that the logo
                  never overlaps with text as the user scrolls. The right column
                  in this outer grid will be the rest of the header, and will
                  itself be a flexbox with row display and space-around
                  justification, to allow each nav option and the space bar to
                  rearrange themselves based on screen width.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The search bar and the search button will be grouped within a
                  div in the right column of the header. This will allow me to
                  control the spacing between the search bar and button
                  differently than the spacing between the other header
                  components (Home, About, etc).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The content of the page will be a grid with two columns. The
                  left column contains the majority of the textual information,
                  and will scroll vertically but not horizontally. There should
                  be no horizontal overflow, as the text should wrap to the next
                  line. The right column contains an image and the 'Functions of
                  the Board...', and will be sticky and will not scroll with the
                  page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The left column will scroll. The table of contents in the left
                  column will contain hyperlinks to different sections of the
                  page to enable quick navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This sticky right column, containing an image and the
                  'Functions of the Board...', will itself be a grid with two
                  rows. This will allow the image and the textbox to fit to
                  adjust the height of the screen. The font size inside this
                  textbox will adjust based on the screen width and height so
                  that it looks like it fits the space.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The text size of the main paragraph content on computer is
                  20px, but will not scale down to 15px for tablet until the
                  screen's width is less than 1100 pixels. This will ensure that
                  the font size doesn't change if the user enlarges or shrinks
                  their window on their computer by a little bit, which could be
                  disorienting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The left and right margins of the computer display will not be
                  hard-coded pixels values, instead they will be based on
                  viewport width so that they adjust automatically to the width
                  of the screen. The top and bottom margins will be set with
                  pixels, given that they should not be dependent on the
                  viewport height.

            &emsp;As my screenshots demonstrate, my redesign faithfully
            implements my Visual Style Design Guide and my mockups. This
            redesign was a valuable exercise in critiquing the usability,
            accessibility, and responsiveness of an existing website, and then
            putting my observations into practice. The
            <a class="link" href="#visual">Visual Redesign</a> section
            specifically describes how I improved these areas. I found it
            suprising how many important websites like the NCSBDE homepage lack
            responsive features, impeding the user experience and making actions
            more difficult. However, I also learned that building a responsive
            website is not at all simple, and takes careful thought, planning,
            and iteration.
