            &emsp;'Responsive' websites use HTML and CSS to automatically resize
            or rearrange their content as the screen's dimensions change. Many
            high-profile websites prioritize responsiveness, however, many
            others with less resources for development and maintenance do not
            react to screen dimensions. In this case study, I take one such
            website and redesign its homepage for responsiveness.

        <h2>Identification</h2>
        <div class="txt-bx">
          <p>
            &emsp;The website I identified for this redesign is the home page
            for the
            <a
              href="https://www.ncdentalboard.org/index.htm"
              target="_blank"
              class="link"
              >North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners</a
            >. I chose this website because it provides important information
            that pertains to many North Carolina citizens, however, it seems
            that the board has not had the resources to make their site
            responsive.

          <h3>Screenshots</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;The below screenshots display the current North Carolina State
            Board of Dentail Examiners (NCSBDE) website at various screen widths
            (375x667px, 768x1024px, and 3840x2160px). These screen widths
            represent the view on a phone, tablet, and computer respectively. As
            shown, the website does not consistently resize or rearrange its
            content depending on screen size, and instead, content often gets
            cut off.

          <h3>Usability Issues</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;After exploring the NCSBDE website, I compiled this table of
            the usability (learnability, memorability, and efficiency) and
            accessibility issues I identified with the website.
