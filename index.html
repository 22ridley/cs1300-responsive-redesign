        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="txt-bx">
          <p>
            &emsp;'Responsive' websites use HTML and CSS to automatically resize
            or rearrange their content as the screen's dimensions change. Many
            high-profile websites prioritize responsiveness, however, many
            others with less resources for development and maintenance do not
            react to screen dimensions. In this case study, I take one such
            website and redesign its homepage for responsiveness.
          </p>

      <div id="id" class="id">
        <h2>Identification</h2>
        <div class="txt-bx">
          <p>
            &emsp;The website I identified for this redesign is the home page
            for the
            <a
              href="https://www.ncdentalboard.org/index.htm"
              target="_blank"
              class="link"
              >North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners</a
            >. I chose this website because it provides important information
            that pertains to many North Carolina citizens, however, it seems
            that the board has not had the resources to make their site
            responsive.
          </p>
          <h3>Screenshots</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;The below screenshots display the current North Carolina State
            Board of Dentail Examiners (NCSBDE) website at various screen widths
            (375x667px, 768x1024px, and 3840x2160px). These screen widths
            represent the view on a phone, tablet, and computer respectively. As
            shown, the website does not consistently resize or rearrange its
            content depending on screen size, and instead, content often gets
            cut off.

          <h3>Usability Issues</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;After exploring the NCSBDE website, I compiled this table of
            the
            <a
              class="link"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/"
              >usability</a
            >
            (learnability, memorability, and efficiency) and accessibility
            issues I identified with the website. To detect accessibility
            issues, I used the tool
            <a class="link" href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank"
              >WebAIM WAVE</a
            >, which automatically detects possible accessibility problems.
          </p>
          <br />
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th style="width: 10%">Learnability</th>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Since learnability refers to the ability of new users to
                    accomplish tasks, one learnability problem is the presence
                    of many deadlinks on the website. For example, the link to
                    the NC Secretary of State website,
                    <a
                      href="www.secstate.state.nc.us"
                      target="_blank"
                      class="link"
                      >www.secstate.state.nc.us</a
                    >, is a deadlink, which is confusing for new users who are
                    trying to navigate this page's resources for the first time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The homepage links to different pages in confusing and
                    disjointed way, since there is a header in purple of pages
                    to navigate to, another row in red of pages below that, as
                    well as a column along the left side of other pages. This
                    disjoint makes it diffult for new users to find the page
                    they need.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Another learnability problem is that 3 more pages are hidden
                    and only show up as a dropdown on hover over Live Scan. This
                    makes it much more difficult for new users to find these
                    hidden pages, including `CBC Requirements', unless they
                    already know to look under Live Scan.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Memorability</th>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    One memorability problem is that sheer number of navigable
                    pages from the home page makes it difficult to remember
                    where a page you have been to before is. Several of these
                    links are very similar and could be consolidated for
                    efficiency. For example, 'Anesthesia/Sedation Permits' could
                    be a subpage of 'License & Permits'. With fewer options
                    visible (and with each option using more space), users can
                    more easily spacially remember what link they want to click.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Another memorability problem with the NCSBDE website is the
                    lack of coordination of colors. The top header nav bar is
                    purple, while the nav bar below that is red, and the nav bar
                    column along the left has no background color. Colors can be
                    a valuable memory trigger for users to remember
                    functionality of components, so a lack of standardization
                    further impedes returning users' abilities to navigate the
                    page.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Efficiency</th>
              <td>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    One strange efficiency problem is that if the user clicks
                    the 'Verification/Disciplinary History' link on the left
                    column, several of the links in the left column disappear,
                    inlcuding `Anesthesia/Sedation Permits'. This inconsistency
                    in the left column nav bar happens on several pages. This
                    impedes efficiency because if someone needs to go to
                    'Verification/Disciplinary History' and then
                    'Anesthesia/Sedation Permits', they have to go back to the
                    home page in between.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Another efficiency problem with the website is that all of
                    the links to other websites (not other pages on this
                    website) do not open in a new window. This means that if
                    experienced users need to go to one of those external pages,
                    then back to the MCSBDE page, they either have to manually
                    open new tabs or have to go back in their history. This is
                    an efficiency issue because it impedes the speed of all
                    users, including experienced ones.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Additionally, the height of this home page impedes
                    efficiency, given that this page single is incredibly long
                    and has 25 sections. There is no table of contents nor
                    hyperlinks to these subsections, so even experienced users
                    who know where they need to go still have to spend a lot of
                    time scrolling to get there.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Accessibility</th>
              <td>
                <p class="pad">
                  WebAIM Wave discovered many accessibility issues. Below are
                  those that I agree with most and found most concerning.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    'No heading structure': The page has no headings, instead,
                    all the text is within a div, span, or p, and mannually
                    styled. This oversight makes it more difficult for Screen
                    Readers to report the structure of this page to users
                    without impairments, and there more difficult for them to
                    use the page.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    'Null or empty alternative text': None of the images on this
                    page have alternative text. This means that Screen Readers
                    cannot report their contents to visually impaired users.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    'Very low contrast between text and background colors': On
                    the left side of the page, there is a sticky box with the
                    label 'Functions of the Board of Dental Examiners' whose
                    green text and green background are very close shades of
                    green. This makes it difficult for colorblind or otherwise
                    visually-impaired users to read this text.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="pad">
                  In my opinion, the biggest accessibility issue is the lack of
                  responsiveness of this page. When the screen is narrow, its
                  contents get cut off, which makes it virtually much more
                  difficult fof users with small screens and physical
                  impairments to use the site.
                </p>

            &emsp;As described, the NCSBDE website suffers from a variety of
            learnability, memorability, efficiency, and accessibly issues. The
            most common themes are the confusing nature of the 3 separate nav
            components, the lack of color coordination, the long height of the
            page and lack of structure, and the lack of responsiveness to narrow
            screens. Addressing each problem would improve the user experience
            and ease of use not just for those with accessibility issues or new
            users, but for all users.
